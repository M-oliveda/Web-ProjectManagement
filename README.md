# Qoop Technical Interview: Web Frontend Client

This project is the web frontend client developed to complete a technical interview for the **qoop.ai company.**

To develop this project, I will use the following technologies:

- **Javascript** (using **Typescript** as programming language) will be the main programming language.
- **React** and react-related library will be used to create UI interfaces and the app behaviour.
- TailwindCSS and ReadyMade React components for UI.

Although this project was designed for a specific purpose, its code is under an **open-source software license.**
